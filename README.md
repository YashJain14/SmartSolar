# SmartSolar is our solution to Food Insecurity in Singapore. We participated in the CYC YouthxHack Hackathon and tackled the problem of food security issues prevalent in society by utilising our skills and creativity to come up with a viable solution
# This is our code for an Anduino module in testing for light, where our LED would represent the backup source of light in case of low light conditions
### To address the problem of food security in Singapore, in particular, reducing our reliance on importation of food. We introduced a lighting system that empowers indoor vertical farmers in Singapore to grow more sustainably, more productively and more cost efficiently. Our lighting system harness the abundant sun rays we have in Singapore and direct this sun rays via optic fiber tubes into different levels of an indoor vertical farm. Supplemented by an artificial lighting system that is activated in low day-light situations. Farmers can harness natural sun rays despite being in a confined space with no access to a roof top. Understanding the need for precision in high tech indoor vertical farms, our group further introduced an IOT device that aggregates both the natural light and artificial light delivery system that allows the farmers to emit precisely the desired luminosity. We hope that this solution will empower existing high-tech indoor vertical farmers and make indoor farming more affordable for new entrants.
